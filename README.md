# Arduino Morse Code Communicator

The Arduino Morse Code Communicator is an interactive project designed to convert text into Morse code signals using LEDs. This project not only serves as an educational tool to understand and practice Morse code but also introduces users to basic Arduino programming and electronics. Featuring a user-friendly interface with start/pause functionality and adjustable signaling speed, it's perfect for hobbyists, educators, and anyone interested in understanding communication technologies.

## Project Features

- **Morse Code Conversion:** Converts predefined text messages into Morse code.
- **Interactive Control:** Utilizes a pushbutton to toggle between playing and pausing the Morse code sequence.
- **Speed Adjustment:** Includes a potentiometer to control the speed of Morse code signaling, making it adaptable for users of different skill levels.
- **Visual Feedback:** Uses a green LED to indicate when the message is playing and a red LED to signal the message's completion.
- **Expandable:** Designed with the flexibility to extend the Morse code library, add more control features, or integrate with other hardware for expanded functionality.

## Potential Applications

- **Educational Tool:** A hands-on way to learn Morse code and basic principles of electronics and programming.
- **Hobby Projects:** Ideal for DIY enthusiasts looking to explore Arduino and embedded systems.
- **Emergency Communication:** Can be adapted for practical applications in remote or emergency communication scenarios where traditional means are unavailable.
